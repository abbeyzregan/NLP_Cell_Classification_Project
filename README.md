# NLP_Cell_Classification_Project

This repo holds the jupyter notebook files that I used to analyze the data for my university computational-biology capstone project. In this project,
I used NLP to classify cells from the ascending aortas of mice. Unfortunately, I cannot share any data because that's confidential, but here I have
put the jupyter notebook files that I used for the project. 

Below are some of the presentations that I created for the project:
